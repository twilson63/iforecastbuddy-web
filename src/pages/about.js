      We know good days to go fishing can be few and far between, especially
      when planning an offshore trip trolling or out past the gulf-stream.
      Weather can be finicky and keeping an eye out for a good day can involve a
      lot of clicking the weather report refresh button up to the morning of
      departure.

      We aim to help fishmermen do what they love - fish, and not waste time
      clicking for the latest weather report, or worse, missing out on a good
      day because you and your crew did not realize one was coming. Sign-up for
      our free weather and ocean monitoring service, pick your area of interst
      and how you want to be kept up-to-date with your weather forecast and we
      will do the rest.
